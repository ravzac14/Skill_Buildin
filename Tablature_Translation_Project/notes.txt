To do for the Main translation class:
	1) Read the MIDI library to find isolated drums
		- Isolate each frequency of drum pieces
	2) Set pace of ticks
	3) In text file: 
		- Use (-) to count "unused" tick
		- In instance of drum piece struck ("used") apply appropriate character
			- 'x' is a normally struck cymbal(C1..C2..C3)/closed High hat(HH)
			- 'X' is a ride bell (RD)/ open High Hat (HH)
			- 'f' is a flam on toms (T1..T2..T3..)/Snare(S)/
			- 'o' is a normal strike on a drum toms/snare/bass (B)
			- 'O' is an accented drum strike, ie rim shot
			- 'g' is a ghost note on a drum
		- Maybe start with just C/HH/S/B

	4) Check for new frequencies, if is new run addNewPiece(): Which opens a new line for writing
	
	5) Maybe eventually add time signatures throughout?


HH---x---x---x---x---x---x---x---x
 S-------o-------o-------o-------o
 B---o-------o-------o-------o----
 C--------x-------x-------x-------

Check line length. Tick lenght > x then \n
