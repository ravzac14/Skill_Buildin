 1.
  Draw the trie with digit numbers for the keys aabbbbaaa, bbbaaabb, aaabaabb, aaaaabaaa,
  bbbaabaa, and aabba. (Assume these are strings, with a termination character.)
  

2.
   Prove or disprove: A perfectly balanced tree forms if keys 1 to 2^k - 1 are inserted 
   in order into an empty leftist heap

3.
   Prove or disprove: A perfectly balanced tree forms if keys 1 to 2^k - 1 are inserted 
   in order into an empty skew heap
  
4.
 For the binomial queue:
 (a)
  Modify the merge routine to terminate merging if there ar eno trees left in Hsub2 and the carry
  tree is NULL.
  
 (b)
   Modify the merge so that the smaller tree is always merged into the larger.
   
 (c)
    What impact do these changes have?
    
    
5.
     Consider the following input with 10 keys (each is a letter) to QuickSort.
     K; G; I; K; N; V; S; S; W; Q
     Assume the leftmost element is the partitioning element. Show the array after the parti-
     tioning step is complete
     
     
6.
    (a)
        Prove that any comparison-based algorithm to sort 4 elements requires 5 comparisons.
        
    (b)
         Give an algorithm to sort 4 elements in 5 comparisons.

7.
          Suppose we implement the median-of-three routine as follows: Find the median of
                a[left],a[center],a[right] 
          and swap it with a[right]. Proceed with the normal partitioning step with i at left 
          and j at right-1
    
    a) input is 2,3,4..n-1,n what is the runtime?
    
    b) input is in reverse order what is runtime?)
