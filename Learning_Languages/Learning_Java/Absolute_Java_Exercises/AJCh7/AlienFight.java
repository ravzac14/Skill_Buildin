/* Zack Raver, ravzac14
 * This class simulates the fights when aliens meet
 * This belongs to ch.7 #3; creates an object for a group of the other alien classes
 * 
 * Could either make a bunch of static methods to:
 * 	determine attack precedence 
 * 	figure out if packs/units surrender(only a chance if p1 is composed of entirely marshmallows (and p2 has at least 1 ogre/snake/god) or if the p1 is <= half the size of p2)
 *  actually make units lose health (UNIT.setHealth(UNIT.getHealth() - PACK2.calculateDamage()))
 *  
 *
 * Or make it OO
