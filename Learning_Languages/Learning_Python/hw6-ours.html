Problem 3: For Loops

While there are two main types of loops, while-loops and for-loops, for this problem, we will 
be working with for-loops. The range() funtion is a common function used to set the number of 
iterations the loop will run for. 

Using a for-loop, give the sum for a(sub n) = a (sub n-1) + 5 
where the first term is 1 and n = 100. 


Problem 4: Writing and Calling Functions

Write a newDivide(a, b) function that takes two parameters and then call it to divide:

a) 10 / 2
b) 57 / 0
c) 26 / -4

Recall that writing functions must start with "def" and may (as with this case) end with a return statement.


Problem 5: Lists

Lists have a set order, which means the different elements in a given list can be accessed by its index 
(eg. listName[0] is the first element of a list). Lists can also be manipulated by various list-related functions
that you can see using dir(list). 

Initialize a list, sampleList[], to the value [0,1,2,3,4,5]. Using the list functions, 
change the even numbers to the string version of the number (ie. 2 is two) and change the range from 0-5 to 1-8.


Problem 6: Scopes

Scopes are different planes of your programming workspace. You will use and change scopes when you use: 
import, (nested) loops, functions, if/else statements

Using your divide() function from Problem 4, execute:

x = 0
for i in range(5):
  x = i
  y = 4*x / x**2        #implement newDivide() function here instead of the "/"

In how many scopes was x used? How many times did the program change scope?


Problem 7: Dictionaries

Using the list you created in Problem 5, make a dictionary that maps "odd" to the odd numbers and 
"even" to the even numbers (eg. {1 : 'odd', 'two' : 'even'}.


Expected Answers:

p3. 5346; if you are near this number it could be that your loop ran one too many or one too few times. 
    Check that the range is going from 1 (default is 0) and too the nth value (100). If you are having problms
    finding any answer consider making each loop print i so you have a counter to check that your value is running
    as you expect it to sum mathematically.

p4. a. 5 b. Undif. c. -6.5; If you are having trouble with part b, keep in mind that you have to clarify in your function 
    what to do when you ask it to divide by 0. If you are having trouble with part c, you may need to take into account 
    float values vs. integer values.
    
p5. [1, two, 3, four, 5, six, 7, eight]; The range change is something to keep in mind from the get-go. You can use this 
    information to immediately remove zero (using the list functions from dir(list)). Then, you can take the remaining 
    even numbers and overwrite them using the assignment operator (=) (eg. sampleList[1] = "two"). Then you can appened 
    remaining terms with the list.append() function.
    
p6. 3 scopes use x, and it changes 10 times; The scopes that use x are: 1. The main scope of the program. 
    2. The scope of the for-loop and 3. The function call of newDivide(). Therefore, it follows that each time you iterate 
    loop and each time you call the function within the loop, the value x is changing scope. Note, this is only possible if
    x has previous existed in the scope you are jumping to. In this case, it is initialized in the main program, it is 
    called in the function call and is inherited and overwritten each time you iterate the for-loop.
  
p7. {1 : "odd", "two" : "even", 3 : "odd", "four" : "even", 5 : "odd", "six" : "even", 7 : "odd", "eight" : "even"}; This
    was mostly an exercise in calling items from a list and creating your dictionaries from these valuse, as you will do
    in hw5p1. Each time you are mapping a value (eg. "even") to a key (eg. two") in this format: sampleList[0]["two"] = "even"
