Good Morning,

I am hoping to replace the hoomeworks with another project. Namely creating an IF (interactive fiction game) 
through the use of PyF and Canopy. I will be writing the script in xml and the coding in python. I realize 
this is a bit late, but I am hoping that will not be a problem. The files for my project (Brains) can be found
in my repository (brains) which you both (Paul and Colin) have been made collaborators of.

Thanks,
Zack R.
