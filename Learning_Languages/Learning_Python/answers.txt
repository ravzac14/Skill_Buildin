Homework 3 and 4

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3

Problem 3:

It gave me an error that said we used "linoleum" without initializing it (defining).

Same as the above error, we used gc_count without defining it.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7

Collaboration:

No collaboration on this one

Reflection:

I found it interesting learning to run python programs with relevant text files through the command line. The loop was straightforward. 


Homework 4:

Problem 5:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7
A-content: 0.5
C-content: 0.2
G-content: 0.1
T-content: 0.2

Problem 6:
These files ran without incident:
test-small

These files had discrepancies:
sample_6 by 10 between the Sum and TotalCount
sampl_5 off by 1 between the Sum and TotalCount
sample_4 
sample_3 
sample_2
sample_1
test-moderate-gc-2
test-moderate-gc-1
test-high-gc-2
test-high-gc-1

The discrepancies always arose between the sum and total count. This is due to other variables (namely: N) being found in the seq. 

Problem 7: 
GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7
A-content: 0.5
C-content: 0.2
G-content: 0.1
T-content: 0.2
AT/GC Ratio:  2.33333333333
Total Content: 10
a + c + g + t:  10
Number of Characters/ Length: 10

Problem 8:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7
A-content: 0.5
C-content: 0.2
G-content: 0.1
T-content: 0.2
AT/GC Ratio:  2.33333333333
GC Percentage: 30.00%.
GC Classification:  low GC content
Total Content: 10
a + c + g + t:  10
Number of Characters/ Length: 10
